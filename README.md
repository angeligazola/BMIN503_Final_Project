This repository contains the work associated with my final project for the **5030 Data Science** course as part of the **Master's in Biomedical Informatics** program at the **Perelman School of Medicine**, **University of Pennsylvania**. The project focuses on investigating the association between **Body Mass Index (BMI)** and the **age of diagnosis of colorectal cancer**.

### Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore whether higher BMI is associated with an earlier onset of colorectal cancer, considering the increasing incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer. By analyzing the **MSK, JNCI 2021 colorectal cancer dataset** from **cBioPortal**, I aim to investigate how obesity (per BMI) may be associated with the age of diagnosis of colorectal cancer in colorectal cancer patients.

The project's analysis is divided into three main sections:

1. **Descriptive Analysis**
2. **Linear Regressions**
3. **Logistic Regressions**

The project's report is being written in R language in a quarto document in RStudio, containing the following structure: overview, introduction, methods, results, discussion and limitations, conclusion and references.

### Repository Overview

This repository includes drafts for my final project, as follows:

- **README.md**: overview of the project and repository contents.  
- **final_project_ANGELIGAZOLA_110524.qmd**: early draft of the project overview and introduction.  
- **final_project_ANGELIGAZOLA.qmd**: latest draft with all project sections, including methods and results. 
- **final_project_ANGELIGAZOLA.html**: rendered HTML version of the latest draft for better visualization.


### Guidance

My project advisors are:
- **Prof. Dr. Gary Weissman**, Assistant Professor in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine and Informatics, who provided insight into refining the research question and data analysis approach from a clinical perspective.
- **Nicholas Bishop, BA**, Clinical Research Coordinator, who assisted in developing the methodological approach and visualizations for the dataset.

Their expertise has been instrumental in shaping the direction and execution of this project.

### Next Steps

- Refine project draft, incorporating feedback from peers and advisors
- Reach a final version of the project.
- **Final Submission:** The completed project will be uploaded to this repository by **12/13/24** (due date).
