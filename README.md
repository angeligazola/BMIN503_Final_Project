## Antonia's BMIN5030 Final Project repository:
### Project title: BMI and Colorectal Cancer
#### by MBMI Student Antonia Angeli Gazola

This repository contains my drafts for my final project for the **5030 Data Science course**, taught by **Prof. Dr. Blanca Himes**, as part of my Master's in Biomedical Informatics at the **Perelman School of Medicine**, **University of Pennsylvania**. My final project advisors are **Prof. Dr. Gary Weissman** and **Nicholas Bishop, BA**.

This repository is forked from the original main repository by Prof. Himes. My work stays in my local branch, which contains the following files:

- README.md: provides an overview of the project and repository structure.

- final_project_ANGELIGAZOLA_110524.qmd: an early draft of the project overview and introduction.

- final_project_ANGELIGAZOLA.qmd: the latest draft with all project sections.

- final_project_ANGELIGAZOLA.html: a rendered HTML version of the latest draft for better visualization.
  
This project is still in work and under refinement.  
The final version of my project will be added before 12/13/24 (due date).
